# Xs1sTz
## About Me
Iâ€™m currently focused on learning cybersecurity and programming, and making fun command-line games
I like hashing, and encryption systems.

## Hobbies
I enjoy game developing mostly in python and unity.
I love command line interface and the possibilites with it.
I like creating 3D models for unity from time to time as a hobby.
I enjoy programming puzzles and CTFs.

## Profile Overview
Most of my uploads will be small programs centered around cybersecurity. Most frequently mini-programs and, occasionally, larger projects that require more time to develop. and from time to time games

#### Note: My intentions are educational and personal fun. I create these programs for learning purposes and to help others with the same goal.
### *I do not condone or support any form of unethical hacking.*

## Good Luck
I hope you find my repositories useful and that they help your path in coding and cybersecurity!
