## Hi Im Xs1sTz
I'm currently learning cybersecurity and programming 
learning algorithms and encryption, hashing systems
i enjoy coding and i enjoy sharing
i usually code stuff that i dont find boring,
so i will not upload very much softwares as much as i will
upload 'tiny' programs that are usefull, mostly in cybersecurity,
i will upload more mini programs and from time to time
i will upload major programs that take me more time
 
i hope you find my repos useful and i hope they
will help you on your journey of coding and cybersecurity!
